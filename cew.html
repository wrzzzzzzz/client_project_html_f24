				<h2>Brief History</h2>
				Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women’s center.
				Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then
				known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of
				service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues
				its work today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders,
				facing education, employment, or other life issues.
