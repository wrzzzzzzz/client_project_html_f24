				<h2>Main Mission</h2>
				Academic Advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans
				with guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and
				questions with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of university
				and program requirements, policies, and processes. Together, we develop an academic plan that aligns
				with the student's personal and professional goals.
